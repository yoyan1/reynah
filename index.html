                    <h3>Moon gazing</h3>
                    <p>Moon gazing is one of my favorite hobbies every time I go outside at night because watching the moon gives me a peaceful mindset. While watching the moon, I can't help but wonder about the immense love of God for His people, as even at night, He provides us with beautiful sights like the moon and the stars.</p>

                    <h3>Singing</h3>
                    <p>Singing, especially Christian songs, is one of my stress reliever. Understand and feel the essence of a lyrics of a song, especially Christian songs, often give you the encouragement to continue fighting through life, even when you're tired or facing many problems.</p>

                    <h3>Capturing Nature</h3>
                    <p>Looking at the beautiful scenery in nature, I just can't stop myself from taking pictures. Because looking at this kind of beautiful scenery makes me wonder how much we are loved by God, as He has given us such beautiful sights in our surroundings.</p>
